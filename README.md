##Break Points
I used media screens on my pages. The pages have a mobile view when the min-width is 
under 700px. When the scree is between 700px and 1000px, the page goes to a tablet view. Finally, when the page contains 
over 1000px, it will snap to a desktop view automatically. This is known as responsive web design. The home page has a 
three column layout in the the desktop view with three pictures in a line. In tablet, the far right picture stacks 
below the top two,and in the mobile view all pictures stack. The schedule page resized intuitively. The final page was the most
difficult. In the desktop view, the page has two pictures on top, three in the middle, and four along the bottom.
In the tablet view, the page has two pictures on top, three in the middle, and the bottom row spilts into a stack 
of two and two.

##Column Layout
The home page as a three column lay out with three pictures each getting their own column. On the Former Players page,
the layout has a two, three, and four column layout.

##CSS Continuous Loop
The home page contains the infinite loop.  The middle picture of the field spins continuously once the page 
loads. It spins clockwise from the origin. 

##CSS User Interaction
When you roll over the picture (.logo1) on the left of the homepage, the photo will flip 180 degrees and turn 
upside down.

##Background Image
Each page has the ND logo as the background image. 

##Visual jQuery Interaction
The schedule page has a paragraph that can have its font resized simply by inputting a font size and clicking a
button.
